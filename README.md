# An application built with Flutter and love to demo an object detction and image classification feature on a flutter app.

## Features
1. Objects detection
2. Classification of images captured by the devoce camera
3. Trained model from Torchscript


### Packages
 [image_picker](https://pub.dev/packages/image_picker) 
 [Flutter_pytorch](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_pytorch)

 **Learn more about Torchscript on the [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html) official docs**

 Don't forget to run
 `pub get' after cloning the project and update all necessary packages and also feel free to update the model as you wish


 **Note!**  *The model is not entirely accurate as you might encounter some wrong classifications

 ** All issues and suggestions are appreciated

 ## Made use of the YOLO(You only look once) algorithm
